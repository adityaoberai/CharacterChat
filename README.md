**Response**

Sample `200` Response:

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "answer": "As flattering as it is to be associated with such an iconic figure, I'm afraid I'm just a businessman with a keen interest in the welfare of Gotham City. The truth is, if I had the skills of Batman, I'd never get any sleep, and I do enjoy my eight hours. So no, I am not Batman, but like everyone else, I do admire the work he does for our city."
}
```
